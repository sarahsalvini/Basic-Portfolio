          Sarah Salvini is currently attending the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at the University of Kansas. She is working towards gaining more knowledge and entering the tech field. She obtained a bachelors degree of science in Journalism from the University of Kansas and William Allen White School of Journalism and Mass Communications. Her degree was focused on strategic communication with a concentration in public relations and marketing. 
          <br></br>
          Sarah has always enjoyed learning and developing new skills. She  started learning basic HTML for fun and decided to further her education. Her hope is to connect her degree in strategic communication to the knowledge she earns from the coding bootcamp.
