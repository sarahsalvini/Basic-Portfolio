<h1>Unit 01 HTML, CSS, and Git Homework: Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Build a professional portfolio site using HTML and CSS following a set of specifications and a style guide.</h2>

<h2>User Story</h2>
AS A web developer
I WANT a deployed portfolio
SO THAT I can showcase my applications to potential employers and clients

<h2>Business Context</h2>
A portfolio is often the first point of contact for employers looking to fill a position or clients in need of a developer to complete a project. A clean and informative portfolio showcases a developer's strongest work and can lead to employment and/or more clients.

<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
GIVEN that an employer or client wants to hire a developer
WHEN viewing their portfolio
THEN they are able to learn about the developer, find contact information, and follow links to projects and repositories

<h2>Instructions</h2>

3 HTML documents: index.html, contact.html, and portfolio.html.

A folder called assets.

Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: css and images.

In the css folder, make a file called style.css.


<b>IMPORTANT Your site's layout must match the designs in these screenshots.</b>



Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun; show your personality!
The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name isâ€”that is fine and expected.


<h2>Style Guide</h2>

<ul>
<li>Colors (Pro Tip: Use the Eye Dropper Chrome extension to find the colors that are used on webpages.)</li>

<li>Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): #4aaaa5</li>

<li>Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings): #777777</li>

<li>Main header background color: #ffffff</li>

<li>Main header border color: #cccccc</li>
  
<li>Footer background color: #666666</li>

<li>Main content background color: #ffffff</li>

<li>Main content border color: #dddddd</li>
</ul> 



<b>Fonts:</b>

For heading fonts use font-family: 'Georgia', Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;

For all other fonts use 'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;




<b>Profile image in index.html:</b>

Use a picture of yourself.



<b>Portfolio images:</b>

Save the images to your images folder.

<b>Background images:</b>

The background pattern used was found on Subtle Patterns. You can browse through that site and use whichever pattern you like.



<b>Dimensions:</b>

The entire content and the main section content area is 960px wide.




Make a "sticky footer." You will notice that the dark gray footer will always rest just below the content. This is fine whenever your site has enough content to push it down past the height of most monitors. But if there isn't much content in the body, the footer could rest in the middle of the page:

Try to code the footer in a way that it will always remain at the bottom of the page, no matter how short the content is. Refer to this sticky footer tutorial for guidance.
Give the footer the following CSS: border-top: 8px solid #4aaaa5;




Look into these concepts: float, padding, margin, display, overflow, clear and text-align.
